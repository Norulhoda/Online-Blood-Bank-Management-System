# Online-Blood-Bank-Management-System
The Online Blood Bank Management System is a project aimed at  connecting blood donors, recipients (patients), hospitals, and blood banks  through a web-based platform. It simplifies the process of blood donation  and transfusion by enabling donors to register, recipients to request blood,  and blood banks to manage blood stocks efficiently.
